  /* What is Quantization? 
   
   From WikiPedia "a process that reduces 
   the number of distinct colors used in an image, usually with the intention that the new 
   image should be as visually similar as possible to the original image. Computer algorithms 
   to perform color quantization on bitmaps have been studied since the 1970s. 
   Color quantization is critical for displaying images with many colors on devices that can only 
   display a limited number of colors, usually due to memory limitations, and enables efficient 
   compression of certain types of images."

   Image caption: Dr. Wernher von Braun in his Office - Dr. Wernher von Braun is in his office, with an artist's concept 
   of a lunar lander in background and models of Mercury-Redstone, Juno, and Saturn I. Dr. Wernher von Braun, the first 
   MSFC Director, led a team of German rocket scientists, called the Rocket Team, to the United States, first to 
   Fort Bliss/White Sands, later being transferred to the Army Ballistic Missile Agency at Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, Alabama.
